      <h2>The beginning of my journey</h2>
      <p class="dynamic">
        Hi there! I'm {username} (aka {username-alt}). I have been working on projects for {years} years.
        My projects have mostly been things that I either could find useful, or things that I have had fun making.
        I have been the main developer for a group of hobbyists I made for {goofballyears} years called "<a href="https://github.com/Figura-Goofballs/">Figura Goofballs</a>".
        At the time I thought it was a good name, because the original goal was to make things for the <a href="https://figuramc.org/">Figura</a> minecraft mod.
        Most of my projects from my first 2-3 years are gone forever. I also have little memory of those projects.
        In 2024, I remade one of my old (and terrible) discord bots in a more modular way. You can find it <a href="https://github.com/TheBunnyMan123/TheBunnyBot-v2">here</a>. 
      </p>  

      <h3>Getting into web development</h3>
      <p class="dynamic">
        Around {webdevyears} years ago I started getting into web development. I took a class in my final year of middle school, but I had already
        known most, if not all of what was taught. The web development projects I still have are listed below.

        <ul>
          <li><a class="dynamic" href="/projects/AB-Injector.html">A:B-Injector ({since-2023} years ago)</a></li>
          <li><a class="dynamic" href="/projects/speech">Speech Synthesis Text ({since-2023} years ago)</a></li>
          <li><a class="dynamic" href="/projects/vidplayer">Video Player (currently broken, use embeddable) ({since-2023} years ago)</a></li>
          <li><a class="dynamic" href="/videoplayer">Embeddable Video Player ({since-2023} years ago)</a></li>
          <li><a class="dynamic" href="https://github.com/figura-goofballs/better-newtab">Better New Tab ({goofballyears} years ago, with Figura Goofballs)</a></li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>Developing Mods for Minecraft</h3>
      <p class="dynamic">
        Around {webdevyears} years ago I started with developing mods for the game "Minecraft". These mods are coded in java.
        My first mod was a re-creation of the mod 'WorldEdit' that internally used Vanilla commands,
        allowing it to be used on any server you had permission. My second mod was made with the
        "<a href="https://github.com/Figura-Goofballs/">Figura Goofballs</a>" group, and it was called "GoofyPlugin". It is a plugin for the for the <a href="https://figuramc.org/">Figura</a> mod
        that adds many useful things that wouldn't normally be added. All of my minecraft mods are listed below.

        <ul>
          <li><a class="dynamic" href="https://github.com/TheBunnyMan123/WorldBender">WorldBender</a></li>
          <li><a class="dynamic" href="https://github.com/Figura-Goofballs/GoofyPlugin">GoofyPlugin</a></li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>Lua Shenanigans</h3>
      <p class="dynamic">
        Many of my coding projects are made Lua, an easily embeddable programing language. Some of my first things were made on
        "Roblox", which uses lua. {webdevyears} years ago, I discovered the "Figura" mod for the first time, and immediatly started
        making an avatar. A year later, I created a custom OS for the "ComputerCraft" mod for Minecraft (specifically the CC: Tweaked fork) called "GoofballOS" with the "<a href="https://github.com/Figura-Goofballs/">Figura Goofballs</a>" group.
        This OS was almost fully backwards compatible with the built-in OS at the time.

        <ul>
          <li><a class="dynamic" href="https://github.com/TheBunnyMan123/Small-Bunny-Avatar">Figura Avatar</a></li>
          <li><a class="dynamic" href="https://github.com/Figura-Goofballs/GoofballOS">GoofballOS</a></li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>See the #</h3>
      <p class="dynamic">
        {webdevyears} years ago I created a Calculator and Timer program in C#. I created these because I wanted to use
        programs I developed myself. These were created with the "Avalonia UI" framework.

        <ul>
          <li><a class="dynamic" href="https://github.com/TheBunnyMan123/Calculator">Calculator</a></li>
          <li><a class="dynamic" href="https://github.com/TheBunnyMan123/Timer">Timer</a></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
